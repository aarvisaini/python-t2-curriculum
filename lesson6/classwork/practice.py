# Problem 3
# Create a list of tuples called points with 3 points:
# (0, 0), (2, 5), (4, 1)
# Loop through points and print each x and y.



# Problem 4
# Ask the user for two numbers.
# Store them in a tuple and print the tuple.



# Problem 5
# Create a function called add_and_multiply(a, b).
# It should return (a + b, a * b) as a tuple.
# Call it and unpack the results, then print both.
